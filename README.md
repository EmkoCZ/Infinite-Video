# Welcome to GitHub Desktop!

This is your README. READMEs are where you can communicate what your project is and how to use it.

Write your name on line 6, save it, and then head back to GitHub Desktop.

This is a simple projcet which can turn mp4 videos into hundreds of hours long videos or discord crashing videos.

Super long videos have to be mp4, I haven't tested any other video types with crash videos.
Super long videos have their head data changed so it will not effect the actual video length.
If you want to make a crash video, you'll need a video with big resolution, I recommend googling more information about it.
