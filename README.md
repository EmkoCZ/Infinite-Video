# Infinite videos and Crash videos!

This is a simple projcet which can turn mp4 videos into hundreds of hours long videos or discord crashing videos.

Super long videos have to be mp4, I haven't tested any other video types with crash videos.
Super long videos have their head data changed so it will not effect the actual video length.
If you want to make a crash video, you'll need a video with big resolution, I recommend googling more information about it.

# Set-up READ This
You'll need to download ffmpeg.exe for the crashing videos.
If you do so drop the ffmpeg.exe file to folder InfiniteVideo\InfiniteVideo\bin\Debug\.
Super long videos don't need ffmpeg file

# Discord crashing videos
As mentioned you'll need ffmpeg.exe file for this. There are plenty of websites/tutorials about where to download this program.
You will also need high resolution video, Discord crashes for sure with video with resolution 15000x15000.
When creating discord crash video you will also need to change pixel format of the other video to yuv444p, you can do this using ffmpeg.
When you're puting in the file path of the videos keep in mind that you need to enter first the path of the video with changed pixel format and then the video with high resolution.
