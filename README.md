# Infinite videos and Crash videos!

This is a simple projcet which can turn mp4 videos into hundreds of hours long videos or discord crashing videos.

Super long videos have to be mp4, I haven't tested any other video types with crash videos.
Super long videos have their head data changed so it will not effect the actual video length.
If you want to make a crash video, you'll need a video with big resolution, I recommend googling more information about it.
